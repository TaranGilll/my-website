# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website: https://www.tarangill.org!
If you want to get to know me better, head over to my website to learn more about my passions and 
some of the projects I've been working on recently. My website utilizes React, 
Javascript, AWS Amplify & S3 (for hosting resources and deployment), and HTML/CSS.
